## What was this study about?

- The study was designed to test whether the speed of your decisions about reality is influenced by a feature of the environment.

- Previous studies have shown that people are faster to correctly detect the number of dots presented to them when the number of dots they see and the number of dots seen by a person in a room is the same, compared to when they differ. This effect occurs when the person is presented at the same time with a room containing the dots.

- Similarly, studies have shown that people react faster to objects appearing in the location that was gazed at, compared to objects appearing in the location that was not gazed at. However, this only happens when the gaze cue (e.g., eyes) is presented a few seconds before the target object.

- We wanted to test whether one reason for the difference between the two tasks is the use of a word indicating who needs to respond. In the first task (with dots and a room) participants are shown a "YOU" to indicate they need to judge what they see. This may lead to participants realising that there is another perspective, aside from their own, that could be taken. No such indicator is present in the second type of experiment (with the eyes).

- Thus, for this study we assigned participants to one of two groups. One group received an indicator - "YOU“ that may help lead to the realisation that another perspective is possible and a second group received an indicator "NOW“ that should not have had this effect.
